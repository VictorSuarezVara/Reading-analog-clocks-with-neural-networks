Put the handles in the midel of the same images of the same size like the ones presented

Fourth step:
Change the angulus using the helper_to_rotate_the_extracted_parts_of_the_clock.py program so the handles start pointing 0 hour, 0 minute, 0 second

Last step:
Execute the AnyClockDatasetGenerator.py and make shure that all his requiriments are well.
